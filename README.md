This is the repository for Cesar, Josue, and Hardhik's implementation of the ECE128 Final Project design. This project consisted of implementing a vending machine that accepts nickels and dimes and displays the amount of change given back when necessary. For the design source, add the file without the "_tb". For the simulation source, add the file without the "_tb". Ensure the appropriate file is enabled for running synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation, and waveform generation. To use the Basys3 FPGA with this project, load the constraint file. The five switches on the furthest right side of the board control one nickel each, and the three switches on the furthest left control one dime each. To "receive a soda", enter any combination of 25 cents or more; if you input exact change, the furthest right LED will light up, signifying you received a soda. However, if you input a total more than 25 cents, another LED to the left of the soda LED will illuminate, and the amount of change given back will appear on the seven-segment display.
